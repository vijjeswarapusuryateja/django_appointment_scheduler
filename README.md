    # Appointment Scheduler Package
    'django_appointment_scheduler',
]
```

### Step 6: Define Your Models (`main/models.py`)
Create a simple model to test:
```python
from django.db import models

class Tutor(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

```

## üìù API Usage

### Set Availability for a Tutor
You can pass list into weekly_offs
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tutor/1/set-availability/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "start_date": "2025-03-24",
        "end_date": "2025-03-31",
        "start_time": "10:00:00",
        "end_time": "15:00:00",
        "slot_duration": 30,
        "weekly_offs": ["Sunday"]
      }'
```
You can set the entire date range as Off by using the keyword ‚ÄúOff‚Äù in the weekly_offs list. This is useful when you want to mark a period as completely unavailable.
```bash
"weekly_offs": ["Off"]
```
Additionally, you can pass multiple weekdays to the weekly_offs list to mark specific days of the week as unavailable.
```bash
"weekly_offs": ["Sunday", "Friday"]
```

### Book an Appointment
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tutor/1/book-appointment/1/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "customer_name": "Alice Johnson",
        "booked_by": "Admin"
      }'
```

### Cancel an Appointment
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/tutor/1/cancel-appointment/1/
```
